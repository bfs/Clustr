# INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THINGS WITH apt-get

# Make sure you have gcc and g++ installed
# $> apt-get install g++

# On Ubuntu you will need to add the "multiverse" to your /etc/apt/sources.list
# file. See also: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine

$> apt-get install libcgal-dev
$> apt-get install libgdal1-dev 

# You might as well install gdal-bin while you're here but that's
# not technically necessary for Clustr.
# $> apt-get install gdal-bin

# If you haven't already done this part, then grab Clustr from github.
# $> apt-get install git-core
# $> git clone git@github.com:straup/Clustr.git
